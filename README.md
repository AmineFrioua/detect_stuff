## About 
This is a testing Repo for trying different algorithms to detect stuff in a video. 
The premiss for this is to try different stuff before using a script that will work in the Demo for our Platform in Industrial ML Inc professional settings.

## Technologies used 
- Python Duh 
- Open CV
- Tensor flow Models (I will not upload in this repo the models that I used for tests, secret stuff for work)

## Different Scritps used 
- Script to detect a human in a video 
- Script to detect animal in a video
- Script to detect humans and if they cross a forbidden area, you can imagine this as a factory machines and workers should not cross to a certain area
